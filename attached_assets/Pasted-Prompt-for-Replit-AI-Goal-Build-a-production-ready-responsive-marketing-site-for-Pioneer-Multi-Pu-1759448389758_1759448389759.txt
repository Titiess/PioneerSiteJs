Prompt for Replit AI

Goal: Build a production-ready, responsive marketing site for Pioneer Multi-Purpose Cooperative Society Ltd. (“Pioneer Cooperative”) using Python + Flask, matching the look/feel of the mockups we discussed (Nigerian corporate microfinance vibe: dark pine greens, clear typography, strong hero with blurred overlay). Everything should be in one project and runnable on Replit with no manual tweaks other than uploading two images (logo + hero).

1) Tech & Project Setup

Stack: Python 3 + Flask (no DB; store form submissions in CSV).

Run command: python main.py (app runs at 0.0.0.0:8000).

Environment: Create main.py, templates/, static/css, static/js, static/img, and data/.

Secret: Use SECRET_KEY from env if present; fallback "dev-secret".

11) Acceptance Criteria (must pass)

Replit project runs with Run (starts Flask on port 8000).

All routes exist and render exactly as specified with the given copy.

Header is sticky, translucent, and shows active nav link; CTA is styled.

Home hero uses background photo + overlay + H1/subtitle + two buttons.

Forms:

Client required attributes on necessary fields.

Server validation errors flash and preserve inputs.

Successful submissions append a new row to appropriate CSV then redirect to /thank-you.

Theming: dark pine aesthetic, mint text, gradients, cards, buttons as defined.

Responsive on desktop/tablet/mobile (grids collapse cleanly).

Project includes placeholder logo.svg and hero.jpg so it looks good even before user uploads theirs.

Code is organized and readable (Jinja templates extend base.html).

No 404s, static assets load, and no console errors.

12) After Build: Quick Usage Notes (show to user in README or console)

To replace branding, upload:

static/img/logo.svg (or PNG/JPG and update <img> path in base.html)

To change colors/spacing: edit static/css/styles.css.

To add more FAQs or products: edit templates/faq.html / loan_products.html.
